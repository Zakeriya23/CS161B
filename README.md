# CS161B

Course Description
CS 161B explores intermediate-level problem solving, algorithm and program design, loops, control structures, subprograms, and arrays. Emphasizes the development of medium-sized projects using a high-level programming language.

Intended Outcomes for the Course
Create small computer programs to implement algorithms that solve problems.
Apply ethical software engineering practices as determined by the Association for Computing Machinery.
Apply iterative, modular, and array constructs.
Assess algorithmic design, software reusability, and user interfaces.
Effectively use software development tools.

Weekly Structure
The course design is consistent within each module:

Weekly Overview: Lists the Learning objectives for the module and will explain what you will be learning, why you will be learning it, and how to be successful.
zyBooks Activities and Assigned zyLabs: All of the learning materials are hosted in the only zyBooks textbook. You will complete a chapter each week, including videos, lessons, interactive activities, and assigned zyLabs.
Linux Instruction: You will be assigned chapters to read in the PCC Linux and Vim manual. Chapters include practice exercises to complete on the PCC Linux server.
Discussion: You are expected to work with a partner from your study group to design and code a solution to a problem posted on a discussion topic. You will share a link to your solution for feedback from peers. This is a great way to see how other people solve the same problem and get feedback for improvements.
Assignment: You will have a programming assignment each week, including an Algorithmic Design Document and C++ program. Your design document should be submitted by Wednesday for feedback before completing the C++ program. Planning is an integral part of the coding process!
Weekly Summary: This page includes a wrap up, key takeaways, and additional resources.
Attendance & Participation
Students in this course are expected to enter the course at least three times a week to check announcements and email, study the learning materials, complete assignments, and work on projects. For each credit hour, a student should expect to spend at least 3 hours each week during a 10-week course. You can expect to spend at least 12 hours per week on this 4 credit course.

zyBooks
zyBooks is the interactive textbook that we will be using in this course. You will work through a chapter each week, which includes lessons, videos, and interactive practice. You are required to complete 100% of the Assigned zyLabs, at least 70% of the Challenge Activity, and at least 80% of the Participation Activities to receive a grade for your programming assignments. Take a screenshot of your zyBooks % and completed zyLabs and paste it into your Algorithmic Design Document.

Programming Assignments

There will be 8 programming assignments through this term. Each programming assignment consists of an Algorithmic Design Document and a C++ program (code). Your submissions will be graded according to the Assignment Rubric; you can grade your own work and determine what grade to expect before submitting. For each assignment you submit, you will be required to answer a question that asks you to think about your learning - each assignment will have a different question to answer! Please post the answer to the submission question in the comments box when submitting your assignment to D2L.

Algorithmic Design Document: Before beginning any programming assignment, it is important to plan! You will be planning out the logic in pseudocode or flowcharts and starting with the end in mind, what the user will see when they run your program. Your design document will guide you by starting with the end and then planning the logic by thinking about the program inputs, outputs, calculations, and the steps to solve the problem. You will submit a DRAFT of your design document by Wednesday for feedback. Remember, feedback is always meant to help you improve - I have high expectations, and I know you can do it!

C++ Program (Code): After you have completed your planning document, you are ready to write your C++ program! You have already worked through the logic, and now you have to translate those steps into something the computer can understand. This is where you will be learning the rules, called syntax, of the C++ language - and there are a lot of rules to follow! Learning the rules takes A LOT of practice, and it can take some time before it clicks. Do your best and submit your work on time for feedback or help. You can always re-submit work as many times as needed to get the grade you want. Assignments MUST be completed on the PCC Linux server and are due by Sunday of each week.


Grading Criteria
I understand the instructions for assignments and discussions will be using vocabulary that is new to you, and it is understandable if the instructions seem confusing or unclear. Please read over all assignments and discussion prompts in advance and reach out if you have any questions or if you want to confirm you understand them correctly. Clarifying questions will help you avoid deductions in your grades. Learn more about the Grading Guidelines at PCC.

Grading Scale
This course uses a 4.0 grading scale because it:

Letter Grade	4.0 Score	Level
A	3.4 - 4.0	Exceeds
B	2.8 - 3.3	Meets
C	2.0 - 2.7	Approaching
D	1.2 - 1.9	Not Yet
F	0.0 - 1.1	No Evidence

0 (No evidence). This isn't a grade as much as a mark to indicate there is no basis for assigning a grade.
1 (Not yet). The evidence shows insufficient learning to pass the course in most areas.
2 (Approaching). The evidence shows learning is sufficient in many areas to pass the course, but some gaps remain.
3 (Meets). The evidence shows learning is sufficient to pass the course in all areas.
4 (Exceeds). The evidence shows learning in all areas is beyond what is required to pass the course.
